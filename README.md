# SerialRGB
Arduino Code (from within Visual Studio) to control Strands of 12v RGB LED strips over serial communication. 
Also contains Python code for a desktop gui. 
Python app requires PySerial and PyGTK.
Tested on Win7 x64 and Windows 8.1 x64 with an Arduino Leonardo and Uno
If using a Leonardo with USB communication flash the Uno version.
Supports 2 RGB LED strips, one on pins 3 (Red), 5 (Green), and 6 (Blue); and the other on pins 9 (Red), 10 (Green), and 11 (Blue).
Made for my own usage but feel free to edit and use as needed.
Original GUI code taken from http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=8332.0 but has been modded significantly to support multiple LED strips and other features I implemented.
